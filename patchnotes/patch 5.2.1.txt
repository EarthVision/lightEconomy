- money top command shows now only players (towny accounts are not shown in the top command)
- money top command formating number
- money balance command now shows the correct format
- adding a new command called /money addall [amount]. With this command you reward all players from the database with
  a specified amount of currency. All online Players will be notified. Also, you get messages, if any transaction
  failed from the global pay. Players where on a different Server get no message. That's not possible at this moment.
  Watch out that a big amount of players can provide massive lags for a short time!!! This command is not rated
  for big networks with a high amount of player count.
- new entrys in the message.yml. Feel free to translate it into your language.
- fix a bug, that spam no offhand messages in the chat, if the voucher moved in the inventory
- added new console command to delete a specified user from the database /eco delete [username].
  The target player will be kicked from the server with a custom kick message.
  No MultiServer support right now. That means, if the player is on a different Server, he is unable to kick.
  It will still work, but the player MUST BE RECONNECTED to the Server. Otherwise, errors will flood your console
  from each server due not finding an economy account. (In this case I recommend to delete a user account,
  if the player is offline)
- updated JDK to Java 20
- updated plugin to newest 1.19.4 server engine
- money top command shows now all offline players too
